The 2014, historical thriller film, The Imitation Game, directed by  Morten Tyldum, 
is based on the biography of the world war II hero, Allan Turin, who brings victory to 
the Allies by inventing a revolutionary machine that would give birth to the computer age. 
The film portrays some of the Saint Leo  University's core values. The university offers a practical, 
effective model for life and leadership in a challenging world, 
a model based on a steadfast moral consciousness that recognizes the dignity,
 value, and gifts of all people. This paper gives an overview of the film and discusses some of
  the University's core values portrayed in the film.
  The film begins with  Alan Turing being interrogated by two policemen 
   who apparently broke into Turing's home. The storyline switches to Turing's 
   early life, from how he was bullied  at  a boarding school where he became friends with  Christopher Morcom,
                  Christopher would later unexpectedly from bovine tuberculosis after 
                  Turing had confessed his love to her.
